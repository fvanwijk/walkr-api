# Walkr API

REST API for Walkr. Got the inspiration from Pok√© API.

See [walkrgame.com](http://www.walkrgame.com)

# Usage

run `node ./server.js` to start the server. You need to have MongoDB running at localhost:27017.

See http://localhost:1337/api for all the endpoints.

Initially the database is empty. Use the POST endpoints to add data from the json files located in the *data* directory.
